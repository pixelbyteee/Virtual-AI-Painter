ðŸŽ¨ AI Virtual Painter

Turn your webcam into a live, gestureâ€‘controlled drawing canvas. This Python app uses realâ€‘time hand tracking (MediaPipe + OpenCV) so you can draw, erase, change colors, and adjust brush size using nothing but intuitive finger gestures.

## 1. ðŸ§¾ Overview
The Virtual Painter overlays your drawing actions onto a blank canvas while showing the live camera feed. A header bar at the top acts as a toolbar for color selection, erasing, and clearing the canvas. Pinch gestures dynamically change brush or eraser thickness.

---
## 2. âœ¨ Features
- Realâ€‘time hand landmark tracking (MediaPipe Hands)
- Two interaction modes: Selection vs Drawing
- Color palette (easily extendable)
- Eraser tool & Clearâ€‘All button
- Dynamic brush/eraser size via pinch distance
- Visual feedback: highlighted tool, live cursor size
- Separate paint layer blended over camera feed
- Lightweight, dependencyâ€‘minimal implementation

---
## 3. ï¿½ Requirements
Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.10). Install dependencies via `requirements.txt` or manually:

Core libraries:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- numpy

Optional (for future extensions):
- pillow (exporting images)
- pyinstaller (packaging)

---
## 4. ðŸš€ Installation
Clone or copy the project folder (shown here as `Virtual_Painter`). If you cloned a larger parent repository, `Virtual_Painter` is already present.

### (Recommended) Create a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

### Install dependencies
Using the provided file:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or minimal manual install:
```powershell
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

---
## 5. ðŸ—‚ Project Structure
```
Virtual_Painter/
    main.py                # Application entry point (UI loop)
    handtrackingmodule.py  # Wrapper around MediaPipe Hands
    Header/                # Toolbar icon images (order matters)
        1.png
        2.png
        3.png
        4.png
requirements.txt         # Dependency list (root of workspace)
```

Icons in `Header/` are read in sorted order to build the toolbar. Replace them to customize tools/colors.

---
## 6. â–¶ Running the App
From inside the project (after activating your venv):
```powershell
python main.py
```
Then point your webcam at your hand. Press `q` to quit.

---
## 7. âœ‹ Gestures & Controls
| Mode | Gesture | Action | Visual Cue |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| Selection | Index & Middle fingers up | Hover over header icons to pick tool/color | Rectangle between raised fingers |
| Drawing | Only index finger up | Draw with current color | Colored circle at fingertip |
| Eraser | Same as drawing while eraser selected | Removes strokes (draws in background color) | White (or background) circle |
| Clear Canvas | Select clear icon | Wipes all strokes | Canvas resets |
| Resize Brush/Eraser | Pinch (Thumbâ€“Index distance) | Adjust thickness dynamically | Cursor circle grows/shrinks |

Pinch distance is mapped to a thickness range (e.g. 5â€“50). Adjust scaling constants in `main.py` to suit preference.

---
## 8. ðŸ§  How It Works (Architecture)
1. Capture frames via OpenCV.
2. Run MediaPipe Hands to obtain 21 landmark coordinates.
3. Determine which fingers are raised (simple heuristic using y/x comparisons of landmarks).
4. If in Selection Mode: map index fingertip (x,y) to toolbar region and update active tool.
5. If in Drawing Mode: draw line segments from previous to current index fingertip on a persistent canvas layer.
6. If Eraser selected: draw with a thick stroke in background color.
7. Blend canvas layer with live frame (bitwise operations / masking) for a clean overlay.
8. Show combined output plus (optionally) a second window with raw canvas.

`handtrackingmodule.py` encapsulates: initialization, landmark extraction, finger state logic (if implemented there), and convenience helpers for position extraction.

## 9. ðŸ”§ Configuration & Customization
| What | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| Colors | List/array near top of `main.py` | Add RGB tuples & toolbar icon |
| Brush thickness | Variable/scaling factor | Adjust min/max clamp values |
| Eraser size | Separate scaling or constant | Tune independently |
| Toolbar icons | `Header/*.png` | Replace images (same dimensions recommended) |
| Camera index | `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` | Change `0` to another index |
| Output size | Frame resize logic | Use `cv2.resize` or set capture properties |

Export idea: capture final canvas with `cv2.imwrite("drawing.png", imgCanvas)`.

---
## 10. ðŸ›  Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| No webcam feed | Wrong camera index | Try `1`, `2`, etc. |
| High CPU usage | Large frame size | Downscale frames (e.g. 960x540) |
| Laggy brush | Drawing every pixel jump | Add smoothing / interpolate points |
| Gesture misclassification | Ambient lighting / finger overlap | Improve lighting; tweak landmark thresholds |
| Icons not loading | Wrong folder path | Ensure `Header/` is alongside `main.py` |

If MediaPipe import fails: `pip install --upgrade mediapipe`.

---
## 11. ðŸ§­ Roadmap / Ideas
- Save & load layers
- Undo / Redo stack
- Multi-hand multi-color simultaneous drawing
- Shape recognition (automatic circles, rectangles)
- Voice command integration
- GUI overlay for settings (Qt or Tkinter)
- Export time-lapse of drawing

## 12. ðŸ“„ License & Acknowledgements
Choose a license (e.g. MIT) and add it here. If using MediaPipe & OpenCV, retain their respective licenses.

Thanks to the open-source computer vision community for amazing tooling.

## ðŸ™‹ FAQ
**Q: Why are lines jagged?**  Increase smoothing by averaging last few points.

**Q: Can I use this without a mouse on a touchscreen?**  Yesâ€”this is fully gesture-based; the mouse is not required.

**Q: How do I add more colors?**  Add icon + RGB value and extend the selection logic.
